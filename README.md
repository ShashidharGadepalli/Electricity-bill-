A C++ program of electricity bill management system that uses OOPS and file handling concepts. The bill consists of information like CA no which is a unique consumer number and other data like Name,phone no, Units consumed and prices showing the rate list according to the given units.

The program is basically divided into 5 options:
1. adding a record: if new data has to be added.
2. Generating the bill: showing the user his bill when he enters his ca no
3. Searching: searching for the users' record by his phone no, CA no or by his name.
4. Deleting Record: Deleting the users' information by his name,CA no or phone no:
5. Updating the record: Updating the user's information that might change like phone no or in some cases name.


The CA no is generated using randomize function and is different for everyone. The records of the consumers are stored separately in a .bak file extension.

The concept of the program can be applied to various other similar programs like Library management system,Parking management system, Bank System and various other similar topics.
